## Hey there! 👋  <img src="https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=bytesavvie" alt="" align="center" />

I am a senior full-stack engineer, creative coder and self-proclaimed designer who specializes in front-end development. I make it my mission to translate user-focused designs into pixel-perfect websites or applications that run blazing fast. ✨ I'm a very fast learner in most programming languages; with focus on: [`TypeScript`] (and JavaScript 👀) & [`React`](with TSX, of course) & [`Angular`] & [`Vue`]. Also I have strong proficiency with [`Java`] (and [`Spring Boot`]), [`Python`] (and [`Django`]) and [`.NET`] 😄

- 😄 Pronouns: anything you want, as long as it isn't offensive to anyone. He, she, they, doesn't matter to me
- ⚡ Fun fact: I learn the fastest by diving head first into a problem / new thing, and if that doesn't work, by researching it. While counter intuitive, this has helped me get started with the world of programming! Nowadays, I do research, but after I tried figuring out the solution by myself 😅
- 👀 I have an interesting relationship with some languages (like [`Go`]); while I can understand the code and how it works, I am much slower at writing it compared to languages I'm more comfortable with (like [`TypeScript`])

## 📚 Experience

I'm a self taught, full stack developer, that went head first into coding and fell in love from the first lines of code I've written! Started experimenting with coding around **September of 2014** in the [`Java`] programming language. Since **January of 2016**, I switched to JavaScript as my main language, and shortly after moved to [`TypeScript`] (thanks to its much better coding experience), which is what I use daily now. I've also experimented with other languages (such as [`Rust`], [`Kotlin`], [`C#`] or [`Go`]), but so far my language of choice is still [`TypeScript`].

### Key Notes ✍️

- Self taught, full stack developer
- Started coding in **2014**
- Over 7 years of experience with **JavaScript** and over 6 with **[`TypeScript`]**
- Willing to learn new things all the time, and work in teams 😄

<!--## 🔭 Projects

Here are some of my latest projects I have been working on.

[Just Code](https://just-code1.netlify.app/)
This project was created to help people learn how to code with javascript. I found that a lot of sights like hacker rank and leet code are good for studying advanced concepts, but not so great for people learning how to code. I created this site to help others learn how to code by creating simple straightforward problems to solve. These problems are also inspired from problems I have had to solve in my day to day job, instead of just fancy algorithmic problems meant to trip you up.

[Invoice Generator](https://lesson-invoice-generator.netlify.app/)
I built this application for one of my friends who is a private music teacher. He spends a lot of time putting together invoices for the parents of the students he teachers each month. This program is designed to streamline that process. I also included a way to save and organize a roster of students. This data is present to the user in the form of table to can be easily searched and sorted. I used google oauth to login in the users, firebase to store all the necessary data, and the react-pdf package to create and generate professional invoices that can be downloaded and used as needed.

[Better Music](https://bettermusic.netlify.app/)
I built this project to learn Next.js while taking the opportunity to work on my UI/UX design skills. I heard great things about Next and after using it, I am hooked. Static generation was perfect for this site along with dynamic routing. The image optimization was extremely useful as well. As a bonus, I challenged my self to build everything from scratch. No additional libraries or packages were used in building this project. I learned a ton from doing this and am glad I took the opportunity to do so.

[Outdoor Adventures](https://outdoor-adventures1.netlify.app/)
Full Stack app that let's you explore all the national parks. Search and filter through all parks and click on a park in the table to view an individual page for that park.
